- Detailed Solution: Provide a complete solution in LaTeX.
- Distractor Analysis: Explain why each incorrect option is plausible but wrong.
- All equations and mathematical expressions must be formatted in valid LaTeX.
- Explanations and error analysis must not share the same prefixes or suffixes like "Explanation:", "Reason why", or "Proof:".
- Use a blank line to start a new paragraph instead of "\n" or "\\".

Constraints:
- Exact and manageable answer.
